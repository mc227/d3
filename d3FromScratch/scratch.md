I already have the live plotting that i need.
I just need to fetch the real time data 
I also need to be able to customize that graph
i got it from here https://gist.github.com/pjsier/fbf9317b31f070fd540c5523fef167ac#file-script-js
i need to understand the graph
i need to be able to change the graph at will
I also might need to mock the API

so today to further my goal i need to go through the live d3 lessons. I'm actually understanding it better. I'm glad.

i have some consensus of the stuff I'm learning. the stuff i read on d3 for the impatient is on the live lessons d3.
I'm really enjoying the lessons. I'm so proud of myself. this is the stuff i wanted to learn and be able to do years ago.
I just wish i had more pesistence back then.

10:23
there's so many things i want to learn. I wish i had the focus and time to learn them.

I understand better the d3 syntax but I feel like I'm far from where i need to be.
